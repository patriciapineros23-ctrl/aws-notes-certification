# Module 2 â€“ Lesson 3: EC2 Instance Types

## What types of EC2 instance types are available and their characteristics

### 1. General Purpose
- **Balanced mix** of compute, memory, and networking resources.  
- **Use cases:** Web services, code repositories, workloads with uncertain performance requirements.

### 2. Compute Optimized
- Optimized for **compute-intensive tasks**.  
- **Use cases:** Gaming servers, high performance computing (HPC), machine learning, scientific modeling.

### 3. Memory Optimized
- Optimized for **memory-intensive tasks**.  
- **Use cases:** Large datasets, data analytics, databases, real-time analytics.

### 4. Accelerated Computing
- Uses **hardware accelerators**, like GPUs, to efficiently handle tasks.  
- **Use cases:** Floating-point calculations, graphics processing, machine learning.

### 5. Storage Optimized
- Optimized for **high performance with locally stored data**.  
- **Use cases:** Large databases, data warehousing, I/O-intensive applications.
