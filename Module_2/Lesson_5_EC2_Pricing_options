# Module 2 ‚Äì Lesson 5: Amazon EC2 Pricing Options

## Amazon EC2 Pricing Models
AWS offers multiple ways to pay for Amazon EC2 depending on workload and budget.

### 1. On-Demand Instances
- **Pay-as-you-go** pricing (by the second or hour).
- No upfront payment, no long-term commitment.
- Flexible and simple.

**Best for:**
- Short-term, unpredictable workloads.
- Development and testing environments.
- New applications where usage can‚Äôt be predicted.

---

### 2. Savings Plans
- Flexible pricing model (commit to a specific amount of usage for **1 or 3 years**).
- Applies to EC2, Fargate, and Lambda.
- Up to **72% savings** compared to on-demand.

**Best for:**
- Workloads with predictable usage.
- Organizations wanting flexibility across instance types and regions.

---

### 3. Reserved Instances (RI)
- Commit to a specific **instance type and region** for **1 or 3 years**.
- Significant discount (up to **75% savings** compared to on-demand).
- Offers payment options: all upfront, partial upfront, or no upfront.

**Best for:**
- Steady-state workloads (e.g., databases, enterprise apps).
- Applications with predictable usage patterns.

---

### 4. Spot Instances
- Use **unused EC2 capacity** at up to **90% discount**.
- AWS can reclaim (terminate) the instance with a **2-minute warning**.

**Best for:**
- Flexible, fault-tolerant workloads.
- Batch processing, big data, analytics, CI/CD pipelines.
- Not suitable for critical or production workloads that require guaranteed uptime.

---

### 5. Dedicated Hosts
- Physical servers dedicated to your use.
- Allow you to use existing software licenses (compliance requirements).
- More expensive but required in specific cases.

**Best for:**
- Regulatory or licensing requirements.
- Workloads needing physical isolation.

---

### 6. Capacity Reservations
- Reserve EC2 capacity for a specific **Availability Zone**.
- Ensure availability when you need it, independent of pricing model.
- Can combine with RIs for cost savings.

---

## Reserved Instance (RI) Flexibility
- **Standard RI**: Highest discount but less flexible (fixed instance type and region).  
- **Convertible RI**: Lower discount but can change instance type, family, OS, and tenancy during the term.  

---

## üìù Exam Tips
- **On-Demand** = unpredictable workloads.  
- **Savings Plans** = flexible discount model (commit to spend).  
- **Reserved Instances** = predictable, steady-state workloads.  
- **Spot Instances** = cheapest but not reliable (great for fault-tolerant workloads).  
- **Dedicated Hosts** = compliance or licensing needs.  
- **Capacity Reservations** = guarantee availability in an AZ.  
- **RI Flexibility**: Standard = biggest savings, Convertible = most flexible.
