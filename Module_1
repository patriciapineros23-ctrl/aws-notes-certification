# Module 1: Introduction to the Cloud

## Client-Server Model
- Client places a request
- Server sends a response

## What is Cloud Computing?
- **Definition:** Delivery of IT resources on demand over the internet with pay-as-you-go.

## Cloud Deployment Types
- **On the Cloud**
  1. Migrate data/resources to the Cloud
  2. Develop applications
     - Virtual servers
     - Databases
     - Networking components
- **On-Premises**
  1. Use resources locally with virtualization
- **Hybrid**
  1. Keep some applications on-premises due to regulations
  2. Use the cloud for data processing and analytics

- **Examples**
  - **On the Cloud:** A startup runs its entire website and database on AWS.  
  - **On-Premises:** A bank keeps sensitive financial data in its own datacenter.  
  - **Hybrid:** Healthcare company stores patient data on-prem but uses AWS for analytics.

## Key Benefits of Cloud Computing
1. Trade fixed expenses for variable expenses
2. Benefit from massive economic scale
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Stop maintaining data centers
5. Go global

## AWS Regions
- Geographical locations close to your users

## Availability Zones (AZ)
- Sectors within regions
- Minimum 3 per region

## Advantages
- High availability â†’ minimal downtime
- Fault tolerance
- Close to end users

## Customer Responsibilities
- **AWS Responsibilities:** Security *of* the cloud
- **Shared Responsibilities:** Depends on service, vary by service
- **Customer Responsibilities:** Manage workloads, store info, patching OS, configuring services securely, managing data.
## Takeaways
- Cloud computing = flexible, on-demand, pay-as-you-go resources.
- AWS handles infrastructure; customers manage workloads and data.
- Hybrid deployments help meet regulatory and compliance needs.
## **key definitions:** 
**Cloud Computing** Delivery of IT resources (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) on demand via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
**Elasticity** The ability of a cloud system to automatically adjust resources to match demand (scale up or down as needed).
**Scalability** The ability to increase or decrease capacity manually or automatically to handle workload growth.
**High Availability (HA)** Designing systems to remain operational with minimal downtime, even if part of the infrastructure fails.
**Fault Tolerance (FT)** Designing systems so that they continue to operate correctly even if one or more components fail.
**Regions** Geographical areas in which AWS provides services (e.g., US East, Europe). Each region is isolated from others.
**Availability Zones (AZs)** One or more discrete data centers within a region, designed for fault isolation. Usually a minimum of 3 per region.
**Edge Locations** Locations used by AWS for caching and content delivery (CloudFront) to reduce latency for end users.
**Client-Server Model** A computing model where the client requests resources or services, and the server provides them.
**Shared Responsibility Model** Security and compliance responsibility is shared between AWS (security of the cloud) and the customer (security in the cloud).
**On-Premises Deployment** Running applications and services in your own data centers, using local infrastructure.
**Cloud Deployment** Running applications fully in the cloud (AWS-managed resources).
**Hybrid Deployment** A combination of cloud and on-premises deployment to meet business, regulatory, or performance requirements.
