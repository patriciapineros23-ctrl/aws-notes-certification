**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Name:** Patricia  

## Objective
Understand AWS global infrastructure, including **Regions**, **Availability Zones (AZs)**, and **Edge Locations**.

---

## Steps Completed

### 1. Check Current Region
- Current AWS region set to: **N. Virginia (us-east-1)**  

### 2. Explore Another Region
- Switched to **Ohio (us-east-2)** and **Oregon (us-west-2)**.  
- Observed differences in available services depending on the region.

### 3. Explore AWS Global Infrastructure
- Opened [AWS Global Infrastructure Map](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)  
- Noted:
  - Closest regions: US East (N. Virginia, Ohio)  
  - Number of AZs in each region: e.g., N. Virginia – 6 AZs, Ohio – 3 AZs  
  - Edge locations present for content delivery  

### 4. Screenshot 
- Took a screenshot of the Global Infrastructure map for reference.  
- Saved as `AWS_Global_Infrastructure.png` in `/screenshots/` folder.

## Learnings
- **Region:** large geographic area containing multiple AZs  
- **Availability Zone (AZ):** isolated data centers for high availability  
- **Edge location:** delivers content closer to users via CloudFront  
- AWS services and resources exist **only in the region selected**.  
- Choosing the right region matters for latency, cost, and availability.
