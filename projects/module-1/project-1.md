## Steps Completed

### 1. Log in to AWS
- Logged in with root account email.  
- Verified account access and eligibility for Free Tier.

### 2. Selected AWS Region
- Changed region to **N. Virginia (us-east-1)** for consistency with tutorials.  
- Confirmed region selection for all subsequent projects.

### 3. Explored AWS Services
- Searched and clicked through the following services:
  - **S3** (Simple Storage Service)  
  - **EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud)  
  - **IAM** (Identity and Access Management)  
- Familiarized myself with their dashboard layout and menus.  

### 4. Checked Billing & Free Tier
- Opened **Billing Dashboard** → **Free Tier usage**  
- Verified $0 spent.  
- Created **Zero Spend Budget Alert** ($1 threshold) to monitor any unexpected charges.  

### 5. Pinned Frequently Used Services
- Pinned **S3**, **IAM**, and **Billing** for quick access in future projects.  

### 6. Verified Support Plan

## Notes / Learnings
- AWS regions are important; all resources exist only in the selected region.  
- Free Tier allows safe exploration of AWS without costs, but monitoring usage is important.  
- Root account should be secured with **MFA** and used only for billing or account setup.  
- Pinned services make navigation faster for ongoing hands-on practice.

## Next Steps
- Module 1, Project 2: Explore AWS Regions & Availability Zones.  
- Module 1, Project 3: Create first S3 bucket and upload a file.
